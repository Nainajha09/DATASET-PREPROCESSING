# DATASET-PREPROCESSING
📖 Project Overview

This project analyzes air quality in India using a dataset obtained from Kaggle  [Dataset]([https://www.kaggle.com/](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shrutibhargava94/india-air-quality-data)
. The goal is to preprocess the data, handle missing values, and extract meaningful insights, including correlations among            various gases.

🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 🐍

- Pandas (for data manipulation)
        
- NumPy (for numerical operations)
        
- Matplotlib (for data visualization)
        
- Seaborn (for correlation heatmaps and visual analytics)

🔍 Data Preprocessing

- The dataset contained missing values, which were handled as follows:
        
- Missing values were replaced with the mean of the respective column to maintain consistency.
        
- Unnecessary columns were removed for better clarity and analysis.
        
- Duplicates were checked and removed if found to ensure data integrity.

📊 Data Analysis & Visualization

- Correlation Analysis: Extracted relationships between different gases.
        
- Used Seaborn to visualize correlations.
        
- Time-Series Analysis: Explored trends in air quality over time.

- Scatter & Line Plots: To understand gas concentration variations.
        
- Box Plots: Identified outliers and distribution trends.
